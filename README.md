# Azamuku V2 (modified)

Short description

This repository contains a modified fork of an existing project that I adapted into a Hoaxshell-like tool. I am not the original author — I forked and modified the project to explore and prototype features. This README does not provide step-by-step instructions for deploying or using potentially harmful capabilities.

**Purpose**

- Provide a high-level record of the repository and the changes I made.
- Preserve attribution to the original project and its authors.
- Clarify structure while avoiding operational guidance that could enable misuse.

**What I changed / Notes**

- This fork adapts parts of the original project toward a Hoaxshell-like workflow and payload templates.
- I focused modifications in the `core/`, `masks/`, and `payloads/` subfolders.


**Repository structure (high-level)**

- `original_README.md` — original author README
- `azamuku.py` — top-level launcher / helper script (project-specific)
- `core/` — server and mask HTML templates (server components and masks)
- `payloads/` — payload templates and tunnel/hotplug lists
- `MASKS.md` — documentation or notes about masks
- `requirements.txt` — Python requirements for components in this repo


**Security & Responsible Use**

This project contains dual-use tooling. It may be used for legitimate research, testing, or education, but it can also be misused. Do not use this software for any activity that violates laws, terms of service, or privacy of others.

If you are using this repository for research or defensive work, follow these rules:

- Only test on systems and networks for which you have explicit permission.
- Use safe, isolated lab environments for experiments.
- Respect applicable laws and institutional policies.
